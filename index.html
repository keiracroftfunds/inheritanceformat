<p class="headtitle">Inheritance</p>
  <p>
   As a lady in her late 20s (28 years old), I come from a wealthy family. I was only 10 years old when my father passed away. My father left an affidavit detailing my share of his property, which included only a monetary sum designated for my future well-being. However, there are specific conditions and rules that must be met for me to access this inheritance
   </p>
<p class="subtitle">Condition for access</p>
   <p>I can only access the inheritance portal if I have a fiancé who will take charge and responsibility on behalf of my deceased father. This fiancé would be responsible for withdrawing the funds, and we would then keep the money for ourselves.
   </p>
<p class="subtitle">(After Your Partner Agrees to be fiance )</p>
   <p>Your partner (your client) must contact your lawyer to confirm that he is ready to be your fiancé and is prepared to withdraw all inheritance funds as a beneficiary along with you (the wife). After the agreement is confirmed, the lawyer will release the portal link to the fiancé (client), or you (the wife) can directly provide your fiancé (client) with your inheritance portal link. Just ensure he agrees to proceed before releasing the link.
   </p>

<p class="subtitle">Now, Who is the Lawyer?</p>
   <p>You can also be the lawyer (Case Administrator or representative). Now, as a lawyer, when the fiancé (client) contacts you, ask for some details as a professional lawyer. Here are important questions to ask:
   </p>
   <p><span class="stepsspan">1.</span> Where are you from, state and country?
   </p>
   <p><span class="stepsspan">2.</span> How may I help you, and how were you referred to me? (The client explains that he was referred by you (his wife) to contact you.)

   </p>
   <p><span class="stepsspan">4.</span> Are you ready to marry Ms. [Your Name] and be a beneficiary to the inheritance as well?
   </p>
   <p><span class="stepsspan">5.</span> Great, we have you here, Mr. [Client's Name]. Now we can proceed.
   </p>
   <p><span class="stepsspan">6.</span> Release the details to Ms. [Your Name]'s fiancé (client).
