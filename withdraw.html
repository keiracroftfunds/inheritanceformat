<p class="headtitle">Withdrawing</p>
  <p>
   Fiance should proceed to withdraw the Inheritance funds to his bank, basically he will not encounter any technical issues when withdrawing to his bank account but he may not be credited which is the actual point of this writeups.
   </p>
   <p><span class="subjecttitle">Wife: </span>As the wife (you), rejoice with your fiancé (client) that finally you have gotten your inheritance through him, and he has made you both rich. Explain to him that this is the first time you were granted access to the link, and you couldn't do it without him. Express how excited you are and make him feel worthy of himself. You must let him know that since your father died, this is the first time your father's lawyer has given you access to the portal because you have found a fiancé (client).
   </p>

   <p><span class="subjecttitle">Lawyer: </span>As a lawyer, if the fiancé (client) has access to the portal, withdraw your attention and act professionally; do not contact the fiancé (client), but make him believe they are now successful. The rules for the lawyer are: 'the fiancé must be the one to contact you first on any issue he encounters.' Do not inform him ahead of any issue he may or will encounter.

   </p>

 <p><span class="subjecttitle">Wife: </span>Do not tell your fiancé (client) about any issues he might later encounter. Tell him to make withdrawals to his bank so he can send your share as well, to clear some bills for yourself. Warn him not to screw you up because you believed and trusted him. Also, tell him you can't log in to the account because it only gives access to one person at a time, unless he logs out for you, which you would not suggest since he (client) is already the beneficiary author of the inheritance. Give him loving phrases and sweet words to make him happy. Tell him to proceed with withdrawing the funds to his bank but caution him not to withdraw it all at once because his bank might raise an alarm for money laundering. Advise him to withdraw bit by bit; from $10k to $100k would be reasonable and not raise an alarm.
</p>
<p>After he proceeds and withdraws, ask him for details about what he encounters. He may mention to you that it will be delivered within 24 hours, and he might not tell you about that, but as the wife, you will keep asking him about whether he's been credited or not, using hopeful words to encourage both him and yourself. If the fiancé (client) comes back to you saying he hasn't been credited after 24 hours or less, tell him to contact the lawyer about the issue you and him are facing regarding the withdrawal and your money not being credited to his account yet or he can just contact the customer support directly within the portal.
</p>

<p><span class="subjecttitle">Lawyer: </span>If the fiancé (client) contacts you about not being credited yet, tell him to contact customer support within the portal to ask for details on why he hasn't been credited. Also, tell him to immediately request a refund if they haven't been credited within the time range so they won't lose the money.
</p>
<p>The customer support has answers to all issue you or fiance might be facing.</p>
